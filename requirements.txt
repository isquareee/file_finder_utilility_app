Group 4: File Organizer Utility
Summary: A utility to automatically sort files in a directory into categorized folders (images, documents, audio) with a GUI to preview proposed moves.
Learning objectives (course mapping):
File system classes, exception handling for permission errors.
Regex to detect file patterns or date strings in filenames.
GUI for drag-and-drop preview.


Functional requirements:
Scan a directory, propose categorization based on extensions and filename patterns, perform moves with undo support.


UI requirements:
Directory chooser, preview of proposed structure with checkboxes to accept/reject each move, progress bar during operation.


MVP acceptance criteria:
The app can scan and move files into extension-based folders with a preview step and can undo the last operation.


Stretch goals:
Smart rules (regex-based), duplicate detection (hashing), scheduled automatic organization.


Grading rubric (45 pts for MVP portion):
Correctness & safety (undo feature): 20
UI & preview functionality: 15
Robust error handling: 5
Extras: 5


Starter hints:
Always implement a "dry-run" mode that doesnâ€™t modify files until the user confirms.
Use the hashlib library to detect duplicate files.
