# File Organizer Utility

A Python/Tkinter-based utility that helps organize files in a directory by automatically categorizing them into folders based on file extensions and smart rules.

## Features

- **Smart Categorization**:

  - Extension-based sorting (Images, Documents, Audio)
  - Regex-based rules for filename patterns
  - Custom categories configurable in `config.py`

- **Advanced UI**:

  - Preview moves before execution
  - Select/deselect individual files
  - Progress tracking during operations
  - Detailed error feedback

- **Safety Features**:
  - Dry-run preview before moving files
  - Full undo support for the last operation
  - Duplicate file detection
  - Permission error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- python-pptx (optional, for presentation generation)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
3. Install optional dependencies (for presentation generation):
   ```bash
   pip install python-pptx
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Click "Browse" to select a directory to organize
2. Click "Scan Directory" to preview proposed moves
3. Check/uncheck files to include/exclude from organization
4. Click "Organize Checked Files" to execute the moves
5. Use "Undo Last Operation" if needed

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to:

- Add new file categories
- Modify file extension mappings
- Add regex-based smart rules

## Learning Objectives Coverage

1. **File System Operations**:

   - Directory traversal with `os.walk`
   - File operations via `shutil`
   - Path manipulation using `os.path`

2. **Error Handling**:

   - Permission errors
   - File not found scenarios
   - Operation-specific exceptions

3. **GUI Development**:

   - Tkinter widgets and layout
   - Event handling
   - Progress tracking
   - User feedback

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Regex pattern matching
   - File hashing for duplicates
   - Undo functionality
   - Background operations
